What is the TYNDP, and what is its role in the European energy policy governance?

Grid development is the core instrument in achieving the Energy Union goals. All Europeans aspire to more security of supply, affordable energy prices and sustainable development.

The 10-year network development plan (TYNDP) that ENTSO-E publishes every two year presents how to develop the power grid in the next fifteen years so that it can effectively contribute to achieving these different and sometimes competing goals. 

The TYNDP is the outcome of a 2-year process, starting with the development of scenarios or visions of how the European power system might look in 2030. Over 200 experts Europe-wide carry out regional exploration studies[^7], pan-European analyses and assess projects to reinforce the grid submitted throuh a European wide call for candidatures . 

The present publication complies with the requirements of Regulation (EC) 714/2009, whiwh tasks ENTSO-E with developping a non-binding Community-wide 10-year network development plan, aimed at providing a vision of the extra-high voltage grid in 10-15 year time; and Regulation (EU) 347/2013, making the TYNDP the sole basis for the selection of Projects of Common interest (PCIs). 

What is the link between the TYNDP and the selection of Projects of Common Interest? 

The Regulation (EU) No 347/2013 that the Projects of Common Interest (PCIs) are selected from the TYNDP list of transmission and storage projects. It is the European Commission and not ENTSO-E who selects and adopts the list of PCIs. The PCIs follow a separate process from that of the TYNDP. [^8]

Annex III 2(3) of Regulation (EU) 347/2013 on guidelines for trans-European energy infrastructure stipulates that “…for all … Union lists adopted, proposed electricity transmission and storage projects … shall be part of the latest available 10-year network development plan for electricity, developed by the ENTSO for Electricity….”
 
This means that a promoter willing to have a project labelled as PCI first needs to apply for the project to be included in ENTSO-E’s TYNDP. For example, only projects which are listed in this TYNDP 2016 will be considered by the Commission for its 2017 PCI list.

Regulation (EC) 714/2009 on conditions for access to the network for cross-border exchanges in electricity -defining the ENSTO-E legal mandates- gives to the TYNDP a wider scope: to provide a transparent picture of the European electricity transmission network in order to support decision-makers with regard to grid investment at regional and European level.

The PCI process is led by the European Commission.

Please visit the EC website for information on how to submit an application for the PCIs.

### What is in the TYNDP package? 
The core of the TYNDP package is the result of the assessment of each transmission or storage project in Europe. See the section below “how to read a project sheet” for more details on this. 

The TYNDP and the economic and technical studies performed to produce it generate a great quantity of valuable information on the future of the European power system. Along with the project assessment themselves, these results form the basis of the “TYNDP package” which Executive Summary you are reading now. This package is also composed of several insight reports which provide further regional analysis for key areas and allow to go further on the topics described below. 

#### Stakeholder engagement
The TYNDP is a collective exercise. The quality of its output very much depends on ENTSO-E's ability to engage as early and as extensively as possible with all parties that have an interest in how the power grid is designed. Learn how ENTSO-E did it in 2016 and how it plans to increase participation in 2018. 

#### Future system perspectives
Where does one start to plan network development 15 years ahead? How to make sure the assumptions used are realistic and at the same time future-looking enough? How to broaden the scope of possibilities but maintain a sufficient level of feasibility? Learn how long-term grid planning is done in the TYNDP. 

#### A push for Projects of Common Interest
Why Europe needs an infrastructure push even with more local generation, storage and demand response? Is Europe regulation on infrastructure delivering its promise? What could be done differently to ease the building of priority projects? 

#### Technologies for Transmission System
Current advances in technology offer project promoters many opportunities to implement new solutions to cope with future network development, which is defined in the TYNDP. Together with current technologies, innovative technologies will be incorporated with the existing infrastructure. These technologies have their own learning curves and innovation cycles. Project promotors, regulators and policy makers need to understand something of each technology and their availability by the time of project development. 

#### Viability of the energy mix
The energy mix has been and is facing significant changes accross Europe, with a signficant increase of production of electricity from renewable sources. While it leads to significant reduction of CO2 emissions of the power sector, it creates some additional challenges both from the technical and economic point of view that are being described further in this Insight Report. 

#### The link between system adequacy and the TYNDP
Are there risks to Europe's pan-European adequacy in the next five to ten years? Why is it important to assess adequacy at a pan-European scale? What methodology is ENTSO-E using and does it cater for the rapid change in Europe's generation mix? 

#### Data and expertise as key ingredients
The TYNDP is an open process. This report will give you the list of data sources and tools used by the ENTSO-E experts to make the TYNDP and what you can freely access to support your own research. 

#### Focus on the Nordic and Baltic Sea
Looking at what is driving grid development in the Nordic and Baltic Sea region: integration of the Baltic power systems, enabling North to South power flows? Impact of planned nuclear decommissioning in Sweden and Finland? 

#### North Seas - regional planning
What congestions is the TYNDP tackling in the North Seas region? What progress for the North Sea Offshore Grid? What about a new long term West-East corridor? 

#### North-South interconnections in Western Europe - regional planning
How to plan a grid to manage connection of large renewable plants in the North and in the South? How to move large quantities of renewables accross long distances? See how the energy transition is game changing network development in Western Europe. 

#### North-South Interconnections in Central-East and South-East Europe
Building power bridges between Eastern and Western Europe; relieving the bottlenecks in Central Europe; see what grid development the Central East and the South East regions are facing. 

#### Baltic Synchronisation
How to integrate further the Baltic countries in the European power system? What about the desynchronisation with the Russian power system? What infrastructure solutions for a secure and competitive Baltic power system? 
What other ENTSO-E publications are necessary to get a full picture? 

The TYNDP builds on other documents which are published along the two years process. These documents are therefore not part of this final TYNDP package, but are necessary to get a full picture and dive into how ENTSO-E obtains the TYNDP results. These documents are: 

The Cost Benefit Analysis Methodology: As requested by the Regulation (EU) No 347/2013, ENTSO-E elaborated a cost and benefit analysis methodology (CBA) to assess the transmission and storage infrastructure projects included in the Ten-Year Network Development Plan (TYNDP). 

The CBA was drafted by ENTSO-E after consultation with stakeholders. It was then sent to ACER and the European Commission for opinion and to member states for information. Following the opinions received, the CBA methodology was revised and finally adopted by the Commission early 2015. 

Each project included in the TYNDP is assessed using the pan-European CBA methodology. As such the benefit of each TYNDP project is assessed against nine indicators ranging from socio-economic welfare to environmental impact. Important information relating to the CBA can be found in:

- Cost Benefit Analysis Methodology – Frequently Asked Questions, and our
- Cost Benefit Analysis Methodology – Key Issues 

#### The Scenario Report: 
This  Scenario  Development  Report  (submitted to public consultation in Summer 2015) explores possible  future  situations  of  load  and  generation,  interacting with  the  pan-European  electricity  system.  These scenarios are the baseline on which TYNDP2016 projects have been assessed. The report aims at providing insights on how the scenarios have been developed and how infrastructure needs are linked to choices in future energy policies. 

#### The Regional Investment Plans
The six ENTSO-E Regional Investment Plans were developed from September 2014 to June 2015 as part of the TYNDP 2016. These reports include the main infrastructure challenges and needs of every region in Europe by 2030. They were consulted during summer 2015 and the final versions can be accessed below. 
- Regional Investment Plan 2015 North Sea region — FINAL
- Regional Investment Plan 2015 Continental South West region — FINAL
- Regional Investment Plan 2015 Continental South East region — FINAL

### What is new in the TYNDP 2016? 
The TYNDP 2016 builds on the 2014 release, paving the way to the Energy Union 2030 goals set up in October 2014; accounting for the feedback received from stakeholders, especially DG ENER and ACER through consultations, public workshops, bilateral meetings and regular meeting of the Network Development Stakeholder Group (NDSG); and, on this basis, further improving methodologies and contents. Notwithstanding the usual analyses, from investment needs identification to transmission adequacy assessments, main improvements are:

- 5 scenarios are investigated, with four 2030 “Visions” comparable in main storyline to those of the TYNDP 2014 but refocused to the EU 2030 goals, updated with various evolutions, and designed with new methodologies; as well as a new 2020 “Expected Progress” scenario.
- Thanks to public dedicated workshops, the Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) methodologies have been complemented with more transparent rules to define the reference grid for projects assessments.
- The TYNDP 2016 project list has been set throughout a public process from March to October 2016 under the aegis of the EC, and the active supervision of the NDSG, acting as ethical committee[^8].
- The NDSG has also suggested making project assessment sheets more relevant to local communities, with maps of every project in its local environment and links to complementary national information.
- Project promoters have been invited to complete the ENTSO-E CBA results with their own information and comments to build self-supporting projects assessment sheets and better support the establishment of the 3rd PCI list.
- In addition, prior to investigating grid development issues, power system profitability and operational concerns by 2030 are analysed in a dedicated section of the report.

Although the TYNDP remains a heavy package in its entirety, every page or section is meant to be read stand-alone, and the reader is invited to browse the TYNDP webpage, flip through the reports and focus on the parts that trigger his or her interest.

### How to read a project sheet and Cost Benefits Analysis results? 

Project sheets contain everything there is to know about each transmission or storage project in Europe which applied to the TYNDP. You can access to all project sheets at once, or visit ENTSO-E’s interactive map and click on any project to access its project sheet. 

Each project sheet contains the following information: 

- A general description of the project, and a map
- Information about each investment in the project, including the length of transmission line, the contribution of the investment to the project gross transfer capacity, the current status of the investment, and the status in previous TYNDPs. 	
- Information about which investment needs are fulfilled by the project 
- Detailed results of the Cost Benefit Analysis, as well as an explanation of how to interpret these results.

The Cost Benefit Analysis indicators are presented in detail in the CBA methodology (see above). 

Transmission   projects   are   by   their   nature   multi-purpose. Originally,   the   main   goal   of   cross-border electricity interconnections was to contribute to security of supply. Interconnectors were built to allow for mutual support in case of supply disruptions, thereby ensuring the reliability of electricity supply. Their role in improving social welfare has received growing attention over  the  last  20 years.  More  recently,  and  given  the  ambitious  renewable-energy  and  CO2  targets  of the EU, the integration of electricity from RES and CO2 mitigation appear as new motives for transmission projects. The majority of TYNDP projects contribute to all indicators, proving this multi-purpose characteristic of transmission projects.
