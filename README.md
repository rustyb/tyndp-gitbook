# Executive Report

The 2016 edition of the 10-year network development plan (TYNDP) builds on the 2014 edition and offers a view on what grid is needed where to achieve Europe's climate objectives by 2030. 

Even if local generation, demand response, storage and energy efficiency, will play an increasing role, the studies show that an extension of the current grid is needed to allow the shift of large quantities of renewables to the main consumption centres. 

The TYNDP 2016 foresees around 150 billion euros of investments in grid infrastructure supporting 200 projects in transmission and storage. 

The TYNDP 2016 explores the possibility of a power system where 80% of the emissions will be cut by 2030.
